# Open TTRPG

## Preface:
I love Role-playing Games, ever since I have been exposed to them early on in life. Being a lover of fantasy and fiction I found the idea of a collaborative storytelling game -- novel and exciting. Ever since then, I have created numerous worlds and scenarios for players and when faced with the lack of them; for myself. However, I find the current gaming systems after playing through the lot of them -- restrictive.

What do I mean by restrictive?
What I mean is simple. The gaming systems are based on some kind of a feature/gimmick and not vice versa. 


The main objective of this system is to hand over the power of choice and consequence, as well narration over to the DM and the PCs. I intend the system to be 
1. extensible, 
2. understandable and 
3. entertaining.

I require your help. Help me craft the world and its system in a way that would make it easy for any player or DM to pick and run their current or future campaign with minimum upkeep!Your input is key!

I will in the future make future contributions to my repo here in my github : [here](https://github.com/sayan247/openttrpg.git)
I will be looking at all of your contributions and making those changes to the system accordingly.
